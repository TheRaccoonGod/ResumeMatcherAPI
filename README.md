# ResumeMatcherAPI

### Goal
We want to create a REST API that evaluates how well a candidateâ€™s resume matches a specific job description.  This API will input a job description and a candidate resume and output a match score, skill match summary, and whether or not they are a good fit.

### Reason
We are working on this project to gain experience with working with an API and its inner workings to develop a better understanding of how to use other APIs in the future.

### Project Steps:
- Creating a way to match resumes to job descriptions (potentially use BERT for semantic similarity)
- Build the API with fastAPI
- Containerize the API with docker and deploy the API
